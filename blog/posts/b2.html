    <h1>Playing Catchup {3/16/2021}</h1>
    <h1>General Changes:</h1>
    <h2>Combat Logging:</h2>
    <p>Nobody likes limitations, but nobody also likes annoying combat loggers. We've implemented another system we
        think will not cause major issues, but if any do come along please make a bug report so we can help out and
        remove the issue quickly.</p>
    <h2>Griefing/Trolling:</h2>
    <p>We're adding a change to this rule and will be updated in #rules soon. If somebodies claim is not protected/no
        longer protected, griefing the builds in said claim is not allowed. Breaking blocks in claims were allowed
        beforehand, it's not anymore. You can still take others items though.</p>
    <h1>Plugins added for the Minecraft Server:</h1>
    <ul>
        </p>Created a OnePlayerSleep plugin (Replacement for TimeVote &amp; WeatherVote)</p>
        </p><em>EpicFurnaces</em></p>
        </p><em>UltimateFishing</em></p>
        </p><em>YouTrade</em></p>
    </ul>
    <h3>EpicFurnaces:</h3>
    <p>Furnaces will be like your best friend, if you already have one that is. If you left-click your furnace, there
        will be a new GUI. Now, you can upgrade your furnaces to optimize the cooking speed and the amount you get from
        smelting. But it comes with a price! Be careful of having them overheat, or making your wallet empty. This
        feature also effects brewing stands.</p>
    <aside>
        ⚙ Note: Any furnaces currently in the server will either need to be thrown away and replaced or just placed onto
        the ground again.
    </aside>
    <h3>UltimateFishing:</h3>
    <p>Are you bored? Well, this won't help you... but you can earn some side cash! Buy your self some bait, catch a
        fish and sell em!</p>
    <p>Commands:
        /uf sell
        /uf baitshop</p>
    <h3>YouTrade:</h3>
    <p>Simple. Just a safe way to communicate with people. Scary, I know.</p>
    <p>Commands:
        /trade {player}
        /trade accept
        /trade ignore (This ignores all trades)</p>
    <aside>
        ⚙ Note: You can also Shift right-click a player to initiate a trade.
    </aside>
    <h3>PlayerVaults AKA Backpacks:</h3>
    <p>You want a virtual backpack? Say no more! Get one now, as we might make them difficult to &quot;find&quot; in the
        future!</p>
    <p><em>Commands:</em></p>
    <p>/bp (This can be in any way: bp1, bp 1, bp etc.)</p>
    <aside>
        ⚙ Note: It will cost $2500 per backpack, 3 max.
    </aside>
    <h2>Discord:</h2>
    <ul>
        <p><em>Added channels: self-promotion, trading</em></p>
    </ul>
    <h3>Trading:</h3>
    <p>This channel is used to sell/buy items with others. I wanted to create a bot system for this but seem to be stuck
        at the moment. For now, use the channel any way you find fits.</p>
    <p><strong>Other changes:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <p><em>Difficulty changed from Hard to Normal (Should be a nice fix for most players)</em></p>
        <p><em>RTP range was raised a bunch</em></p>
        <p><em>Lowered teleport cooldown to 2 seconds</em></p>
        <p><em>Iron and Diamonds are now worth 3x more for claims</em></p>
        <p><em>Added a Server Booster role in-game (dm @geekfi to receive the role in-game)</em></p>
    </ul>
